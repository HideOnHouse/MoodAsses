# Mood Assessment with Smart Watch

>Last years, wearable technology became broadly available and popular but, the human emotions that sensors show to us are not being processed enough and are not being used enough. This paper presents how to process data, such as photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors and acceleration sensors, particularly how to remove data that is not available, and also introduces extracted features that using processed PPG and acceleration data to build and train machine learning algorithms in order to predict emotions for the next day. To erase the data, which is not useful, we use statistics of the data that exists inside the sliding window to determine whether the data inside the window is useful or not, and extract 25 different features from the data that filtered out. Training Kernel Ridge Regression Model and Support Vector Regression Model with 25 features, a machine learning model with meaningful accuracy could be created. Using this model to predict human emotions, many interactive artificial intelligence services, such as artificial intelligence secretaries and speakers, can be made more friendly and useful.
